                    Started out as a cottage industry in 2002, within a small house with the kitchen as the production
                    area, a desk that served as an office and 5 staff. Back then we only made simple products like scrub
                    powder, massage oil and bath salt. We now consciously choose to produce handcrafted cosmetics to
                    open work opportunities and utilizing local talents, employ more than 40 staff which includes sales
                    for domestic and overseas, 2 chemists, a design team, production, administration and in-house R&D
                    team with cosmetic competency and a formulator consultant in Netherland, (in order to, striving, as
                    our focus in) following European cosmetics safety guidance.
